i used pandas for the first time recently at a hackathon, realised it's quite handy for data work, and decided to explore it a bit, teach myself how it works and see whether it's worth digging deeper

this repo is a place for me to play with fundamentals/basics of the package, get to know how/what it does, leave myself notes for later
